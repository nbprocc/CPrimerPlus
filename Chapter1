### CHAPTER 1 EXERCISE ###
1. What does portability mean in the context of programming?
    Portability means the ability to run the code, in this case C, on another device without fear of incompatibility. C is unique in this regard as it is pretty well supported on most systems. 
\n
2. Explain the difference between a source code file, an object code file, and an executable file. 
    a) A source code file is the file where all the human-readable code is stored. The file is unreadable to the computer in this state. This code is written by a person. 
    b) The Object file is a translation of source code to machine language created by the compiler. In this state, the computer can read the code, but it is not ready to run as a program  due to lack of libraries and startup code.
    c) An executable file is nearly the same as an Object file, but includes the libraries needed and startup code. The Executable is made by sending the object file through a linker which includes these things. 
\n
3. What are the 7 major setps in programming?
    1. Define program objectives
    2. Design the program
    3. Write the code
    4. Compile
    5. Run the program
    6. Test and debug the program
    7. Maintain and modify the program. 
\n
4. What does a compiler do?
    A compiler takes the human readable source code and converts it into machine language by outputting a .obj file or object file.
\n 
5. What does a linker do?
    A linker takes the .obj file as input and takes the libraries and startup code necessary to output an executable file. 

Programming Exercise:
You have just been employed by MacroMuscle Inc. (Software for hard bodies). The company is entering the European market and wants a program that converts inches to centimeters (1 inch = 2.54 cm). The company wants the program set up so that it prompts the user to enter an inch value. Your assignment is to define the program objectives and to design the program (Steps 1 and 2 of the programming process.)
\n
1. Program Objectives
    1. Take user input as inches
    2. convert inches to centimeters
    3. output conversion
\n
2. Design Program
    1. Prompt for User input as inches
    2. ItoC = UserInput * 2.54  ### ItoC is Inches to Centimeters, UserInput would be whatever the user put in on step 1 ###
    3. Output ItoC value     ### "[UserInput] converted to Centimeters is [ItoC] cm!" ###
